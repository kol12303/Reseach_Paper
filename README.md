## *Article Title*:
> ### **Forecasting Regional Tourism Demand in Morocco from Traditional and AI-based Methods to Ensemble Modeling**.



## *Data File: an excel file which Contains the number of tourist arrivals to each 12 Moroccan regions, where the first sheet contain the data and the second sheet conatain the nomenclature*. 
> ### *The Data File called* **Tourism Morocco.xlsx**



## The Python Codes are seperated based on the article into three Jupyter Notebook:
*Traditional Models, which contain the three adopted models, ARIMA, AR, and the Univariate Linear Regression. with the plots and the accuracy measures (RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and MAE)*
> ### The Jupyter Notebook Called **Traditional.ipynb**

*And a IA-based Models, which contain three adopted models (LSTM, SVR, and XGBOOST). with the plots and the accuracy measures (RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and MAE)*
> ### The Jupyter Notebook Called **AI-based_Models.ipynb**

*And third notebook contains the adopted ensemble model, which combines forecasted values from the tradtional and AI-based models, also with plots and accuracy measures*. 
> ### The Jupyter Notebook Called **Ensemble_Model.ipynb**
