## 1- *Article Title*:
> ###                         **Forecasting Regional Tourism Demand in Morocco from Traditional and AI-based Methods to Ensemble Modeling**.

## 2- *Data File*: 

*An excel file which Contains the number of tourist arrivals to each 12 Moroccan regions, where the first sheet contain the data and the second sheet contain the nomenclature*. 
> #### *The Data File called* **Tourism Morocco.xlsx**

## 3- *The Python Codes*: 
*The codes are separated based on the article into three Jupyter Notebook:
*Traditional Models, which contain the three adopted models, ARIMA, AR, and Linear Regression. With the plots and the accuracy measures (RMSE, MAPE, and MAE)*
> #### The Jupyter Notebook Called **Traditional.ipynb**

*And a IA-based Models, which contain three adopted models (LSTM, SVR, and XGBOOST). With the plots and the accuracy measures (RMSE, MAPE, and MAE)*
> #### The Jupyter Notebook Called **AI-based_Models.ipynb**

*And third notebook contains the adopted ensemble model, which combines forecasted values from the traditional and AI-based models, also with plots and accuracy measures*. 
> #### The Jupyter Notebook Called **Ensemble_Model.ipynb**
